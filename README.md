## **Feedbag Agrihub**

Feedbag Agrihub is a dual-solution platform that revolutionizes food production through soil-less farming and a blockchain-powered network. The platform connects and rewards active players in the food supply chain (farmers, aggregators, and consumers), transforming the way we grow, distribute, and consume food.
