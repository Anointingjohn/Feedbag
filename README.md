## **Feedbag Agrihub**

Feedbag Agrihub is a dual-solution platform that revolutionizes food production through soil-less farming and a blockchain-powered network. The platform connects and rewards active players in the food supply chain (farmers, aggregators, and consumers), transforming the way we grow, distribute, and consume food.


## **Project Overview**
Feedbag Agrihub focuses on two primary areas:

Soil-less Farming: Utilizes innovative farming techniques to enhance food production without traditional soil-based methods, promoting sustainability and efficiency in agriculture.
Blockchain-Powered Network: Establishes a transparent and rewarding ecosystem for stakeholders in the food supply chain. Though this submission does not yet include Algorand smart contracts, the frontend is designed for future blockchain integration.

## **Technical Elements & Technologies Used**
This project leverages a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, performance, and future compatibility with blockchain integration.

Frontend Framework: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
Blockchain-Ready Architecture: Although Algorand functionality is not yet implemented, the structure is prepared for blockchain and dApp integration.
Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling.
